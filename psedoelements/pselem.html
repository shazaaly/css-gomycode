        <li>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional
            recipes served with a modern twist. </li>

        <li>The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they
            rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a
            popular place for a meal any time of the day.</li>

        <li>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue
            their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
            experience as a chef in Italy.</li>
